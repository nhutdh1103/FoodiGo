Problem statement – New local food retailer chain, “OFS”, in the San Jose Downtown area wants to  implement delivery services as part of their business plan.  You are responsible to develop the website  where customer can purchase organic food online (e.g. fruits, vegetables, and other grocery items) into a  virtual shopping cart.  Pay for it online and have it delivered to their home.  Inventory, customer,  transactions are processed and stored in RDBMS. Special note: If the weight of the total order is less than 20 pounds, delivery is free.  Otherwise you will  add a delivery charge of $5 to the order.  You need to track the weight of each food item in the database  and shopping cart.
